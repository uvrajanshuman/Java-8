# Collectors class

Implementation of **Collector** interface that implements various useful reduction operations,
such as accumulation of elements into collections, summarizing elements according to various criteria, etc.

It provides a set of predefined collectors that are commonly used to perform various aggregation 
and reduction operations on streams. <br>
These collectors are used in conjunction with the [collect](../README.md#collect) method of the Stream interface to accumulate elements 
from a stream into a mutable result container or perform various other operations.
